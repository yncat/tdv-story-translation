Another soldier:
Yes sir!
(Trask is arrested)

Captain:
Larson, thanks.

Larson:
you did most of the work on your own, Captain. I just put him to sleep.

Captain:
Haha. I really should send you to confidence boot camp.

Larson:
You're okay?

Captain:
Yeah, I'm a bit stiff, but I'll be fine.

Larson:
I want you down in the medical bay as soon as you get the time. I need to look you over.

Captain:
Sure thing doctor.

Larson:
that was a close one.

Captain:
No shit. Don't worry about me, though. I'll be fine.

Larson:
if you say so, See me as soon as you can.

(Larson  leaving)

Captain:
Jennifer, wait.
(Comes closer)
Good job.

Larson:
Thanks, Captain.

Captain:
Apollo to blaze. Acknowledge, over.

Orion:
Apollo,
this is Blaze, over.

Captain:
Blaze. The situation down here is just gone as shit. Emergency protocols just kicked in. We're going into high alert. Tras was working for Julius and got found out he and I got into a major...


Orion:
Damn...

Captain:
you to continue your objective as planned, head over to the power plant and get rid of it. I'll be sure to keep you guys informed if anything develops.

Orion:
where's Trask?

Captain:
We've got him alive, and he is being interrogated, but that's not your concern. The ground situation is our problem. Take care of your objective.

Orion:
Yes, Captain. you're okay?

Captain:
I need to go see Larson when I can, but I'm feeling fine for the moment.
Remember the lieutenant who was with us during the briefing?

Orion:
Yes. What about him?

Captain:
While I'm away, he'll be covering. You are to follow his orders as if he is me. Understood?

Orion:
Got it.

Captain:
I'll be back on the circuit once I'm cleared. Apollo out.

Captain, announces:
attention all personnel. I am putting this base on lockdown. No one is to get in or out. I want five of our jets to scramble and patrol the base until they are told otherwise. Have three up after midnight and tutoring dad hours.

This is Larson.

Captain:
Larson, chase here. We're now in lockdown. Every service member is to be re examined.

Larson:
Yes, Captain.

(Scrumble jets are up)

Captain:
The Jets are up. I'm coming down to see you. Can you please inform Turner that he will be in charge while I'm gone and med?
