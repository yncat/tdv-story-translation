Captain:
Apollo, to blaze. Do you copy over?

Orion:
Apollo, this is Blaze. I'm reading you loud and clear, over.

Captain:
you've just made it past the coast of the island. Congratulations for making it this far. You're a hell of a pilot.

Orion:
Thanks. It got rough there towards the end, but I'm glad to still be alive.

Captain:
The first thing we'll need to take care of are the training grounds. Julius trains his soldiers constantly in simulated attacks against the island. Getting rid of the training facility will give him one less place to prepare his soldiers. You'll find the training grounds in Sector M 19 on the west coast of his hideout. The grounds are heavily guarded, so try not to attract any attention as you approach. Just get in, blow it up and get out, over.

Orion:
Get rid of the training grounds. Got it.

Captain:
I'll give you further instructions once you've done this. Apollo, out.
