(Knocks)

Captain:
If you're done playing with the door, come on in.

(Orion enters)

Captain:
woods. Good to see you.

Orion:
You too, Captain.

Turner:
hello, Lieutenant.

Orion:
Lieutenant Turner, hi.
Were you up thinking about babes in airplanes, Orion? Doesn't look like you're an early riser.

Orion:
forgive me, Captain, all this is happening pretty fast.

(Everyone laughs)

Captain:
Sit down. Orion, you should learn to loosen up a little. This is going to be a stressful mission. Laugh now and then.
Now, then, as we said yesterday, Turner is going to prep you. I have other things to tend to right now which are more important than lecturing you. I will be your host during the simulation tests, but Turner will let you know how they work.

Orion:
Got it.

Captain:
Good luck, gentlemen.

Turner:
you're going through the same test I went through.
The test will consist of two stages, a speed test and an ACM and dog fighting test. In the speed test, you'll be put up against any number of opponents. Your goal is to complete three laps before they do. We lay out the course for you and tell you what course you should be flying throughout the session. At the end of each race, you will be awarded points equal to the number of craft that we racing you. So for instance, if you place first against three aircraft, you will be awarded three points. You won't be able to progress until you get 20 points or more.

Orion:
What happens if I don't come in first?

Turner:
Your losses won't count against you. We only consider your wins.
Once you score 20 points in the racing simulation, you'll be in the ACM simulation. Here, you'll be put up against any number of opponents. Your goal is to be the last aircraft flying. You'll only get points if you come out alive. Remember that we total your score at the end, not during the match. We don't give a shit if you shoot down some aircraft and then get your ass kicked, you have to be the alone survivor.

Orion:
Understood.

Turner:
Oh, one more thing, depending on what kind of mood the captain is in, he may ask you to land during the simulations. We want to be sure you can fly her and also lay her down gently.

Orion:
tsh!

Turner:
I realize how that sounded after it came out. It's early.
Anyway, if you do successfully land, you'll be awarded three points on top of your score. You may be penalized for an unsuccessful landing, though. so pay attention, right? That's all I have to say. Let me get the captain and show you the console room.
(calls)
Captain Chase, yeah, we're done here. Should I take him to console and get him started? Yes, sir, we're on our way.
(Ends the call)
He's waiting for us. Follow me.

Computer:
Please log in the information requested.

(enters passcode and proceeds to the console room)

Captain:
Orion, everything you see here is code word classified. This little gig is called the Falcon console. We use it to test and train pilots who want to join our team, or, in your case, people who are asked to join our team. The following simulations have been designed to give you a real life feel. The problem we had with previous simulations was the pilots knew they were not the real deal. To solve that, these Sims have been equipped with the latest advances in force feedback and gravity simulation. This will make it as close to real as possible without having to worry about the regulator stepping in to sue us.

Orion:
Holy shit...

Captain:
yep. So don't be surprised if you come out bruised. Naturally, we've toned it down some, but you'll still get a taste of what you'll feel in real life if you make too tight of a turn or your GS go too quickly.
As Turner told you, I'll be your host during these Sims. Turner, you're dismissed. Get out.

Turner:
Yes sir.

(Turner gets out)

Captain:
Orion, we have only 16 hours before you leave. In that time, you need to be done with this bullshit and also be rested enough to fly alert on your mission. Protocol dictates that we put everyone through this test. Unfortunately, I don't make the rules. I've allocated six hours for both tests. That's three hours per test. Let's get started. Oh, and good luck.

Orion:

Thank you, sir.
