Apollo to blaze, return to base. The threat has been neutralized. I repeat, the threat has been neutralized. We are officially stepping down from Red Alert, over.

Despite all of your scientific genius, you're unable to break me. I resisted your twisted mind game and foiled your plans to clone me.

Julius:
Ah, yes, always the unbreakable. You were trained well. Let us have one more. One more!
