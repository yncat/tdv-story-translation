Captain:
Orion, a word?

Orion:
Of course, Captain.

Captain:
do your pre flight?

Orion:
Yes, sir.

Captain:
Good. Didn't want to interrupt that. How are things looking?

Orion:
Your boys did a great job prepping it. I'm impressed.

Captain:
Good to hear.
Orion, I want you to be careful.

Orion:
Captain?

Captain:
Look. As it stands now, we don't know if Julius has infiltrated us. I'm not saying we're being spied on, but it's definitely possible. I think the last attempt to take down this operation failed because the higher ups underestimated the gravity of the situation.

Orion:
understood Captain.

Captain:
anyone could be a clone Orion. Our analysis shows that Julius has made unparalleled advances in cloning, they're losing their artificial traits and in the process, becoming much harder to spot.

Orion:
Yes, sir.

Captain:
Even your Rio could be a clone.

Orion:
What?

Captain:
I'm not saying he is, but we have to be cautious. Stay vigilant.

Reo:
Hey Orion, what are you waiting for? The captain to give you a kiss or something? Get your ass over Here.

Captain:
go. We've got little time left in our window. God speed.
