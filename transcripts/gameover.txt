Captain:
Orion,
(silence)
Orion? Do you read me?
(silence)
Lieutenant Orion. Please respond!
(silence)
God, damn it!

gentlemen, it is my sad duty to inform you that we have lost Lieutenant Orion.
he failed to carry out the objectives given to him, and as a result, we have withdrawn from Brutus Island.
Over an hour ago, we received a message from Brutus demanding our immediate and unconditional surrender.
If we do not comply, he will unleash his clone armies upon the world.
He gives us a simple choice.

Julius:
yield or die!
