Julius:

(Signal loses)

Rio:
Apollo, this is Blaze. Come in, over.

Turner:
Blaze. Apollo, ready to copy over.

Rio:
We just got a nurse up from Julius. I'm sending it your way now, stand by.

Turner:
got it. the captain's back. I'm handing control to him. I'll be standing by his backup. Over.

Orion:
acknowledged. Over.

Captain:
greetings, gentlemen, I'm looking over your data now. Stand by, over.

Rio:
Blaze, standing by.

Captain:
Okay. Blaze. Slight change in plans. Julius really thinks he can fuck with us. We'll show him who's boss around here. Head over to the bridge connecting the east and west sides of the lake and destroy it. It connects two parts of the island and saves the vehicles from having to go all the way around the body of water just to get to the other side of the facility. Destroy that bridge before the vehicles can cross. It'll slow them down by shit loads, over.

Rio:
Got it, out.
