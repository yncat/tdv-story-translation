Captain:
Gentlemen.

Orion and Rio:
Captain!

Rio:
it's so good to be back, sir.

Captain:
your performance was amazing. I really can't say anything else. I'm lost for words. When the President found out about your success, he immediately ordered that both of you get this medal. Congratulations to both of you.

Orion:
Thank you, Captain.

Rio:
What that's it? A medal, No cash, no full paid vacation?

Captain:
AHahahaha. with a wise ass comment like that, I should pin this thing to your ass.

Rio:
I'm taking folks. I think I'll just take the medal.

Orion's fianc√©:
You did it. You saved us all. I'm so afraid I was going to lose you. I'm so glad you're okay.

Orion:
I kept myself in one piece for you.

(A helicopter comes)

Orion:
What the?

Captain:
there he is. Private, the man coming off that chopper was a POW. Get him to the medical bay, run a thorough physical on him. I want him in the best room we have on this carrier after you're done. Every need of his is to be tended to. Got it?

Operator:
Yes, sir.

Captain:
Orion and citrian, or should I say, woods and Smith. We've got quarters, so you set up if you need anything, just let us know. For now, rest easy. Great job, Gentlemen.

Orion and Rio:
Thank you, sir.

Orion:
Come in.

Turner:
Lieutenant Orion, hey.

Orion:
Turner, Boy, am I glad to see you.

Turner:
How was a hell of a job you guys did up there. Captain Chase would like to see the three of us. Lieutenant Centurions are already there.

Orion:
Oh, for what?

Turner:
Beats me.

Captain:
sit down, gentlemen.

(they sit down)

Captain:
we asked agent Bijani To write a report on what he saw and what happened there. After you guys read it, it's going away into the storm Falcon file. This is code word classified material, as has been everything else with the project.

Orion, reading the file:
The cloning malice project, started by James Brutus, had to be stopped. Captain Chase selected me to infiltrate his base and shut down his plans for world domination, code named Operation treasure hunt. The mission was on a path to failure. From the start, my briefer was an anonymous government official. Knowing his name was beyond my pay grade, I got the impression that my life meant nothing to this man. He sent me into Brutus laboratory without any concern for my survival. In the end, it was Julius need for information that kept me alive. I was handed off to this man after meeting with Captain Chase. Once I had gained access to the heart of Brutus laboratory, I was able to erase all of his research and destroy all of his equipment. All that was left to do was escape. Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way I'd planned. The chopper sent to collect me was brought down, but the rescue mission was also a flop.

Orion:
Thank God. Storm Falcon appeared just in time.

Rio:
No kidding.

Captain:
I am very impressed with your work. We're going to call each of you here to discuss your promotions. I'll get nothing but the best for you. You've saved our country.

Orion:
Captain?

Captain:
Orion?

Orion:
I heard agent Bijani killed Julius. Is this true?

Captain:
Yes, that's not a rumor. With his bare hands too. Some of our guys saw the fight. They've never seen anything like it. He slit Julia's throat.

Rio:
Holy shit, really?

Captain:
after a lot of CQC, yeah. I don't think I ever want to be on the receiving end of that man's wrath, but he's got his earnings. He's on his way home. You guys will follow tomorrow.
Gentlemen, great job.

Orion:

Thank you sir.

Turner:
thank you sir.

Rio:
thank you sir.
