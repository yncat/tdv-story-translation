Captain:
Blaze, Apollo, come in, over.

Orion:
Apollo, this is Blaze. Go ahead. Over.

Captain:
Great work. Their comms just went sky high. Looks like the fat lady's finally singing. It's smooth flying from here. Guys, drop the bomb and bug out. Weather's looking...

Julius:
I don't think so, Lieutenant.

Orion:
what the hell? What? Who the fuck are you? How the fuck are you on this channel? What the fuck...

Turner:
Blaze, What the hell?

Julius:
Shut up. Apollo, or should I say, Turner, hahahaha.

Orion:
how the hell do you know his name? And who the hell are you?

Julius:
I think you can answer your own question. Lieutenant, Hmm, let's see. Oh. Orion, yes, that's it. American scum.

Turner:
get off or

Julius:
Shut up Turner!

Orion:
Trask...

Julius:
you really think I'd get all my information from a gamma clone? You see Lieutenant, while you were flying around having fun with your toys, I was building a Lego house. Survival of the fittest means whoever has the bigger toys wins. You Americans think you're the best. When Russia was a threat, you were in an arms race. You were part of the reason we have nuclear weapons in the first place. Now you're blaming the world for the problem. When my brother started his experiments to push science to its boundaries, you just had to step in with your memos and regulations and stop creativity at the door. You can't let people be because people don't fit your interests. Memos, do Do you even know what I'm doing here? Lieutenant, has anyone ever told you? Why did you come here? Why do you keep pushing on while your information is questionable, even after your top man betrayed you, that didn't stop you? Why? Orion.

Orion:
I swore to protect my country and

Julia:
Same mantra, isn't it? Orion, you're a pawn. That's all. Tell me what you think I'm doing.

Orion:
You're a danger to the citizens of my country, and I'm gonna protect my people.

Julius:
A danger, really? Is that what they really told you? Well, I must say, I'm disappointed. I expected something more elaborate, like, you know, a mad man who's an alien. Well, not exactly alien. Well, okay, sort of alien-Ish, so two thirds alien, whatever my point is, you really have no idea what you're seeing. Woods is a direct response to your country's attack. Think about a world where we have no diseases because we can just replace corrupt DNA, where any illness is curable, where we can choose exactly how we want our kids to be. My goal is to advance science to that point without the morally self righteous people blocking scientific advances. My goal

Orion:
Lier! How do you explain all the soldiers defenses, your trust almost killed my captain. You really, truly think I'll trust that sort of shit from you?

Julius:
Ah, yes, chase an accident. I assure you that.

Orion:
was no fucking accident. Your kind is always the same. You know why America exists? Well, here's history one-o-one. too bad you won't be around to see your F
(Files a missile)
because we keep Mad Men like you from running loose and going crazy!

Julius:
This cost me 5 billion! You pay for it all! Hahahahahahaha!

Captain:
Take him down, Blaze.

--- act 1 defeat
Orion:
What the fuck? I thought only Buddhist could incarnate!

Captain:
Orion. Stop talking. You're supposed to be trying to kill that bastard. Fire off a fucking missile for God's sakes!

--- Second act defeat
Orion:

Oh, not again...

Julius:
All standard tournaments come with three rounds. You know, haven't you ever played an arcade beat him up?
