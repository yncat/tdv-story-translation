Julius:
Oh, pity. What an ending to a brilliant story. American scam.
You here, cut the head. We'll well make a show for his superiors.
(cuts off Bijani's head and shoots a photo)
Hold it up, send that photo To that good man, Captain Chase.

Captain:
gentleman.

Orion:
hell shit.

Orion's fiancé:
Who is that?

Captain:
It's him, the agent.

Orion's fiancé:
How? I thought you guys saved him.

Orion:
Captain, what the hell?

Captain:
Julius killed him. He fought bravely, but perhaps all those years and confinement a number on him.
A moment of silence Please for a fallen soldier.

Captain:
Orion, Centurion, in my office.
Where's Turner?

Turner:
Here Captain.

Captain:
Come with us. We need to talk.

Turner:
Yes sir.

---

Captain:
Sit down, gentlemen.

Captain:
We got rid of Julius, but we lost our top agent. Turner, you were in charge of phase two. What the hell happened?

Turner:
Captain, Julius was on

Captain:
Why didn't you guys send in help? Turner, this is the first mission I put you on, and you fucked it.

Turner:
We were in no position to help at the time, Captain. Please　 understand our ground troops hadn't been deployed yet.

Captain:
We are conducting a review of this mission. The agent was vital. He was part of the objectives. You failed that objective. You too.

Orion:
Captain?

Captain:
you saw Julius fall. You saw him get out of his craft. Why didn't you send the missile up his ass?

Orion:
That wasn't our job, Captain. The last orders we had were to bug out after we set the trigger.

Captain:
Orion, you are a robot! You here. You don't become a fucking captain If you're a fucking robot. You didn't even suggest it to me like, Hey, should I stay? Something's going down? No, were all those years in the military academy worth nothing to you? Do you want to fly a cargo plane full of dog shit for the rest of your life?

Orion:
No, sir.

Captain:
don't bullshit me, either of you. We blew it. Dismissed.
gentlemen, great work. I hope you realize you saved our country. We were all in this together. I think all of us here have a lot to learn from this.
Given your information and the orders that you received, I can see why you did what you did. Remember, suggesting things is never out of the question. Even a captain can make bad calls sometimes.

Orion:
Guess that's as close as we'll get to an apology.

Turner and Rio:
Thank you, sir.

Captain:
I'll arrange for transportation. You guys are going home for a break.
the agent was a great loss to us. In the military, we don't make the same mistake twice.

Turner, Orion and Rio:
yes, sir.

Captain:
but we accomplished our overall goal. Julius is dead. One of our guys put a bullet through his head, then the bomb you guys set was triggered. Cloning malice has been demolished completely. Get out.

---

Rio:
Wow.

Orion:
you're telling me.

Turner:
that was fucking intense.

Orion:
So does he like us, or are we really flying planes full of dog shit for the rest of our lives?

Turner:
We're alive. I don't think I care right now.

(Everyone laughs)
