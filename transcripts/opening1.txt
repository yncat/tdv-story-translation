Captain, narration:
Several years ago, a report arrived at my desk informing me that our country's Liberty was at stake. A mad man by the name of James Brutus was attempting to create an army, an army of clones, I decided to send him one of my best agents, a man I'd worked with for years. Private, Echo, please inform agent Bucha that I will see him now. Yes, captain, thank you. You.

Captain:
Good morning, Agent Bijani, have a seat. 
I recently received word from some of my operatives that a scientist by the name of James Brutus is attempting to create an army of clones. 

Bijani: 
How far has he come in his admissions, sir?

Captain:
good question. I have ordered several flybys over his labs. According to our infrared thermal sensors, there are approximately 500,000 clones currently within his organization. 

Bijani: 
Wait, 500,000?

Captain:
Yes, we can't exactly pinpoint when he began this evil venture, but from what we can gather, he has managed to amass an army of 500,000 clones in very little time.

Bijani:
I would presume that you want me to shut down the operation.

Captain:
Yes, you are to stop this mad man and use any means necessary to accomplish your objective.

Bijani:
How much time do I have?

Captain:
You're leaving immediately. This is a time sensitive hit. The longer we wait, the larger his troop base becomes. You'll be briefed along the way. Agent Bijani, good luck. We're counting on you.

Bijani, narration:
The cloning malice project started by James Brutus had to be stopped. Captain Chase selected me to infiltrate his base and shut down his plan for real domination, code named Operation treasure hunt. The mission was on the path to failure. From the start, my briefer was an anonymous government official. Knowing his name was beyond my pay grade, I got the impression that my life meant nothing to this man. He sent me into Brutus's laboratory without any concern for my survival. In the end, it was Julius's need for information that kept me alive. I was handed off to this man after meeting with Captain Chase. Once I had gained access to the heart of Brutus's laboratory, I was able to erase all of his research and destroy all of his equipment. All that was left to do was escape. Unfortunately, things didn't work out in the way I planned. The chopper sent to collect me was brought down, But the rescue mission was also a flop. You 

Bijani:
captain, the chopper is down. I repeat. The chopper is down. 

Captain:
Holy shit. 
Munawar, take cover. Repeat. Take cover.

Bijani:
Roger.
(gunshots)
Fuck... 
(Manages to hide)

Captain:
This is Chase. We've honed it on your signal a second. Chopper is on the way. Estimated time of arrival is two minutes. Keep your guard up. 

Bijani:
Copy that.

Clone soldier:
I'm sorry, Bijani, but the chopper will be leaving without you. Master Julius has plans for you. We're going on a little trip together. 

Munawar, do you copy Munawar? What's your sta...

(Radio being shot and broken)

Clone soldier:
It's lucky for you that my master wants you in one piece.

---

Clone soldier:
master Julius, I have done as you have commanded. Here's the agent.

Julius:
well done, beta nine. Place him in the jeep.

(Places him in the jeep)

Julius:
thank you, beta nine, you have served me well.

(Julius draws his gun)
Clone soldier:
Master?

Julius:
it is imperative that I survive.
You, however, are expendable.
(Shoots and kills beta nine)
Muhahahahahahahahaha!
now then agent Bijani, you and I are getting out of here right after I give you a little shot in the arm. 

Bijani:
What the hell are you gonna do to me?

Julius:
Nothing. This is just a little anesthetic to help you sleep. This will only hurt a Little. what comes Next? More so...
(Shots to Bijani's arm)

Bijani: Ah...

Julius: Hahahahahahahaha!

---

Operator via phone:
we scanned the record, sir, but found no survivors, I'm afraid agent, but Johnny is dead. The odds of him surviving the blast are negligible.

Captain:
Perhaps you're right, but I'm not prepared to declare him dead for now, he's missing in action. That psychopath would not kill a high ranking agent, especially if that agent could provide him with valuable information. No, Munawar is out there somewhere, and I intend to bring him back. Craig Joel, Chase does not leave a good man behind, sir.
(To the operator)
That will be all for now, Soldier.

Operator:
yes, sir.

---

Captain:
Over the next five years, I began to place my specially trained operatives throughout every branch of the armed services. I knew that operation storm Falcon would need eyes and ears everywhere, and hopefully those eyes would bring any promising people to my attention. Fortunately, my plan paid off. Just three years after the plan had been put into motion, I received an email from one of my operatives in the Air Force. 
The email spoke of a young pilot who had become a flying ace with very little effort, the amount of successful missions under his belt and the number of hours he had logged while flying reminded me of a young man I had once served with in Afghanistan. I scanned the email for his name. Sure enough, it was the same person I had served with.
I knew that acting too soon would be a mistake, therefore, I filed away the information I had received about the young pilot and informed my operative within the Air Force to keep a close eye on him. Only when the time was right would I make the call.
Over the next two years, I instructed my agents to continue to gather information on the new Brutus. Eventually, my agents had gathered up all of the information they could about this Julius Brutus. I knew that the time was right. We would strike at the very heart of Brutus Empire, and my old comrade, Munawar, would finally be brought back home. However, before we could proceed, I knew that I would need somebody that I trusted to spearhead the operation. I knew that it was time to offer Lieutenant woods a position with an operation storm Falcon.

Captain:
Hello, I would like to speak to the commanding officer, please.

Operator:
Yes, Williams, this is Chase. How's hammerhead?

Captain:
Hammerhead is doing great. How's avarice? 

Operator:
Avarice is adjusting fine.

Captain:
This completed the code sequence.
Listen up. I need something from you.

Operator:
Go ahead.

Captain:
One of your pilots, Orion, is his call sign. I've obtained authorization from the President to transfer him to my command. He's no longer yours.

Operator:
Yes, I got the memo. I've cleared it. The President was in touch with me before you called.

Captain:
Do me a favor. Inform him that he will be contacted by one of my people and that he is to do exactly what they say.

---

(Phone rings)
Lady:
baby. Baby, answer yourself.

Orion:
Son of a bitch. Who the hell is this? It's 2am...

Unknown voice: I cannot tell all of the information, but I am your friend.

Orion:
I've heard that before. Goodbye. 

Unknown voice:
I understand, but you were recently informed that you will be contacted regarding the new position within the airforce. Is this correct?

Orion:
Okay, lucky for you, you've raised my curiosity. What's this all about?

Unknown voice:
There is an abandoned guestroom, approximately 20 miles from your home. Try there immediately. Do not delay. If you are not there within two hours, the window will opportunity to close, if that's all quite important for taking place. And I am not a man who is fond of wasting time. 

---

Orion:
What am I doing? I must be out of my fucking mind. 
(Runs his car)
(Gets to the destination)
(Draws his gun)
I swear, if this is someone's idea of a prank,
(Dryfires)

Captain:
Lieutenant Orion, welcome.

Orion:
captain, hold it. Prove to me that you are captain, Chase. Prove to me that you are my old friend and mentor.

Captain:
avarice.

Orion:
long time captain.

Captain:
follow me. We don't have much time. 

(In captain's car)

Orion:
Where are we headed?

Captain:
Relax, Lieutenant, everything will be revealed to you at the appropriate time.

Orion:
Damn you, sir...

Captain:
you're still the same cocky some of the bitch I remember serving with on the carrier. I guess some things never change. Hey, Orion.

---

Guard:
welcome, sirs. to pass I will need your ID in clearance code. 

Captain:
Here's my ID. The clearance code is white Gemini.

Guard:
clearance code accepted, sir. You may proceed.

Captain:
At ease private. Orion, come on through.

(They come on through)

Captain:
Have a seat. Lieutenant.
would you like some coffee?

Orion:
Yes, sir, I always loved your personal bruise. 

(Captain turns on his computer)
Computer:
Enter voice authorization sample.

Captain:
Chase, pass code Apollo, renegade.

Computer:
systems accessed.

Orion:
with all due respect, Captain. may I ask? What's going on here?

Captain:
That's why I brought you here. We need to talk.

---

Captain:
in accordance with our protocols, I'm going to perform a retina scan. I'll also be taking your fingerprint. This is simply routine. I'll explain why in a moment. 
Please place your forehead against the device.
(Orion does so)
OK, now lay your hand on the scanner pad.
(Fingerprints scanned)
Using the a retina scan and fingerprints, we will be able to produce your ID card. This will grant you access to most areas of the air base. It also means that you are now a part of the team. Welcome aboard.

Orion:
Thank you, Captain. It's an honor to serve with you again.

Captain:
It'll be just like old times.

( Turner enters)

Turner:
Lieutenant Orion, sir, I'm first lieutenant Turner. I'm working alongside chase on this project as backup. Heard a lot about you.

Orion:
Pleased to meet your acquaintance.

Turner:
Lieutenant, I've been assigned to preppy for this mission, so with the captain's permission, I'm sitting in on the briefing to get an idea of what we're up against and also to get to know you a bit better. 

Captain:
His record is top just like yours Orion, you two should make a good team now.
Then this is classified information regarding one of our past missions. Five years ago, we attempted to put a stop to the plans of a mad man. Please read through the information.

(Orion starts to read)

Captain, narration:
Orion let out a long sigh. His thoughts had to be the same thing going through our minds. Could we really stop Brutus this time? 

Orion:
So we're going in to get the agent back. Correct you in or out? Seems like there's a lot more than me at stake here. I'm in excellent. I have someone who will brief you further on your mission.
Private Echo, please inform the colonel that we are ready for him.
(knocks)
Come in, Colonel. 
(Trask enters)
Orion, this is Colonel Trask. He will be our info advisor on this operation. 

Trask:
Greetings, Lieutenant Orion, Your reputation precedes you.

Orion:
as does yours, Colonel.

Captain:
Orion, you're being involved in a highly covert take down and rescue mission. I will be overseeing the project from here. All of our intel tips are coming from the colonel, so now is your chance to ask him any questions before we send you in. Colonel, it's all yours.

Trask:
This project has two mission objectives. first, to find out if the agent on the original cloning malice project was killed or not, if he's alive, get him out of hostile territory and bring him back to us. Second, to disable Julius operations, that's your job. 

Orion:
Wait, so you guys don't even know if he's alive?

Trask:
You've been in the Air Force a long time now, Lieutenant, you should know better than anyone else that even federal resources are limited to what the President and his people decide to give us.

Orion:
This is the same issue we had last...

Captain:
that was over five years ago. Orion, you'd be amazed how much our technology has improved since then. 

Orion:
Yes, sir, what are the strategic plans? 

Trask:
Julius has kept his operations well hidden. You'll be launching from here and will approach the south coast of an island where his base is housed. The USS Nimitz will be deployed to provide you with ground support should you need to replenish your resources. However, the carrier will not be assisting you tactically once you get to the island. Destroy the training grounds. This will ensure that Julius can't train any more soldiers, at least, he can't use any methods we're aware of.
Next, destroy anything else you are ordered to. Our goal is to take out as many buildings as we can, to bring Julius down to his core. 

Orion:
What about the actual facility?

Trask:
The cloning facility, leave that. After we're positive you've taken out as many resources as are necessary, we're going to send in the Marines to secure the facility and carry out phase two of the mission, getting the agent out of there. 

Orion:
I sure hope he's alive.

Trask:
Your job is to drop a trigger activated bomb onto the facility. Once we have everything we need, the bomb will be activated, and any evidence that something happened there will be wiped clean off the map.
After you drop the bomb, your job is over. You'll be landing on Nimit and will be brought back here.

Orion:
Talk about covert.

Trask:
About that. I want you to keep a couple things in mind. These people are serious. Julius doesn't have human soldiers anymore. All of these soldiers have been genetically engineered to enhance their reflexes, stamina and situational awareness, all this without drugs. What I mean, Lieutenant is that they won't get tired, but you will. Do not let your guard down.

Orion:
understood, Colonel.
I'm assuming you can't fly a chase chopper to watch my ass, right?

Trask:
correct. Due to the nature of this mission, we're sending in minimal resources. We can't risk Julius noticing us before we break the one fifty. The Nimitz will be there on standby if you need her. She's also equipped with a refuel tanker, in case you're in a situation that prevents you from flying back to the carrier. 

Orion:
Better than nothing. How does he grow these things?

Trask:
They're all surrogates.

Orion:
So they weren't recruited?

Trask:
No, they aren't even born from surrogate mothers. They literally come from bottles in his lab. They're all conditioned to protect his goal, his dream of becoming the sole world power and bending everything to his will. If he succeeds, it will be the end of the United States, England, China, you name it. 

Orion:
What are we doing with him once a facility has been secured?

Trask:
That's not my department.

Orion:
If I had things my way at screw diplomacy and kill him off our fucking with our agent.

Captain:
the future of the world depends on the success of this mission. This is what you have been training for, Orion. And I am confident that you will succeed. God bless America and Orion. Good luck.

Orion:
Thank you, sir.

Captain:
That will be all. Tomorrow you will be prepped for your mission. Turner will assess your abilities and make sure that you're ready. The night is our best friend. So you'll be leaving the night after at midnight, we'll see you back here tomorrow morning at o7 hundred hours to get briefed on the evaluation for now. Stand down, dismissed. 

Turner:
See you tomorrow, Orion.
