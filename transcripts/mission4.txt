Captain:
Apollo, to blaze. Come in, over.

Rio:
Apollo, this is Blaze. Go ahead, over.

Captain:
you never fail to impress you with your accuracy. The light shows keep getting better...

Orion:
Whoa!

(A chopper comes and orion shoots it down)

must have gotten ahead of the others.

Rio:
Go ahead. Apollo, we're in the clear. Over.

Captain:
there's a power plant on the east coast of the island in Sector Zulu echo 19. Take care of it. This is Julius main power source. You'll be cutting most of his power supply by eliminating it. Be very careful as you get nearer to the objective, ground control is scouting out the area, and has noticed that security is stepping up. It looks like they are on high alert. They know they are under attack, and Julius is beginning to panic. I am upgrading your engagement authorization. As of right now, you have permission to fire anything you so much as think is a threat. Use your own judgment on whether or not blowing your cover is worth neutralizing your enemy, over.

Rio:
right. We're headed to Sector Zulu echo 19. Say again. Zulu echo 19, we'll let you know if anything else develops, over.

Captain:
I'll do the same. Good luck, Apollo out.

Orion:
and maybe a good idea to hit the carrier first.

Rio:
Good point. I think we're headed for some heavy fire. Give me a sec.
(scans)
Yeah, should be able to make it from here.

Orion:
Okay, thanks for checking.

Rio:
anytime.
