Turner:
Blaze, this is Apollo. Do you copy, over?

Orion:
Apollo, this is Blaze. We read you loud and clear, over.

Turner:
Great work, Blaze.

Rio:
Apollo, we got rid of that air base back there. Where the hell did these guys come from?

Turner:
There seems to be a base that we don't know about. Those choppers launched from somewhere close by. Looks like they were still fresh on supplies by the time they got to you. Your next objective is to seek out and destroy a couple of radar towers. You can find these towers in Sector U 21 near the cloning facility. I have a feeling that things are gonna start stepping up from here, so be extra careful. You're almost done. Don't get cocky, Out.

Orion:
cocky my ass.
