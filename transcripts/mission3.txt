Captain:
Apollo to blaze, come in, over.

Orion:
Apollo. This is Blaze. We're ready to copy, over.

Captain:
That was an awesome explosion. Nice work, guys. There's no time to lose. Julius knows something is going down. Operation cloning malice is now fully underway. Keep your guard up. Watch your back.
Just north of there in Sector l 21 is an air base. That's your next target. Your orders are simple, bring it down using any means necessary.

Orion:
Understood.

Captain:
good luck. Apollo, out.

Rio:
I like that. Man, he's very direct, not wasting time at all.

Orion:
You don't get to be captain unless you got the attitude for it. I just hope they know what they're doing down there.

Rio:
Of course they do. Man, they wouldn't send us up here just because...

Orion:
I know. I still can't get that damn missile off my mind, though. 

Rio:
I'm the Rio on this flight. Relax Orion. I got us both covered.

Orion:
right. Good call on that last one. I probably wouldn't have noticed it If you hadn't said something.

Rio:
don't mention it. It's why they pay me, after all.

Orion:
Sector l 21?

Rio:
Yep.

Orion:
time to make some more light. Whoever said energy can't be created was wrong.

Rio:
Haha, exactly.
