Captain:
On behalf of the United States Air Force, I'd like to congratulate you, Orion, for the stunning skills you demonstrated during the simulations. It's obvious to me you're as good as they say you are, no on second thoughts, that's an understatement. I don't think they've done you justice. Orion, I'm very impressed with what you've shown me today. Now then it's time to meet Blaze. This is the code name we assigned to the aircraft you'd be flying during this mission. 

(Blaze revealed)

Orion:
Wow...

Captain:
Like it? She's top of the line. This is an F 29 fighter jet.

Orion:
Are we flying that thing?

Captain:
Yep, she's all yours. You've got a host of weapons of great radar range. Also has reinforced armor plating and is very stealthy.
The aircraft you are flying during the simulations is modeled after this baby.

Orion:
In all my years with the service, I've never seen anything like it.

Captain:
Well, first time for everything. Welcome to the team, Orion. 

Orion:
Thank you, Captain.

Captain:
Right. We've got 12 hours before operation cloning malice commences. I want you to get some sleep. We're ahead of schedule, so you've got time to eat well and be rested. I called in some grub for you. Go grab it. Stand down. Once we're closer to launch and we've prepped the aircraft, we'll call you until then, dismissed.
